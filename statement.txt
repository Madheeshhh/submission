Problem statement:

1. Requires a User and Account Management System that enables both customers and bank employees to securely manage user accounts, transactions, and branch operations under strict access control and validation rules.

2. The system must support multiple banks, branches, and account types, while enforcing business constraints such as minor accounts, Power of Attorney (POA) operations, and role-based permissions for all actions.

Explicit Requirements:

-The system must handle two types of users — Normal User and Bank User (like Admin or Bank Manager).
-Each user must have unique identification details such as name, DOB, email, and phone number.
-User age must be validated — anyone below 18 is considered a minor.
-Minor accounts can only be operated by a guardian or Power of Attorney (POA).
-The system should support multiple banks and branches under each bank.
-Each branch must store details like name, address, code, and branch manager.
-Users can hold multiple accounts across different banks.
-Account types include Savings, Current, and Term Deposit.
-The system must include login and logout authentication for users.
-It must have role-based authorization, where actions depend on user roles.
-Roles include Admin, BankManager, and Customer.
-Permissions must define what each role can do (e.g., create users, view transactions).
-A user or bank employee cannot delete another user’s account.
-Only the account owner or admin can close an account.
-The system should support multi-currency accounts (like INR, USD, GBP).
-Every operation must check the user’s role and permissions before allowing it.

Implicit Requirements:

-Each email must be unique and used as a login credential.
-Passwords and sensitive data should be stored securely and encrypted.
-The system should automatically identify minors based on DOB.
-All transactions must record their amount, type, time, and status accurately.
-Account balances should never go negative unless overdraft rules are explicitly defined.
-A guardian or POA must already exist as a valid registered user.
-The system must maintain referential integrity between users, accounts, banks, and branches.
-Deleting a user or bank should not leave orphaned accounts or transactions.
-Admins are responsible for managing roles and assigning permissions.
-All validation and access checks must happen before any database updates.
-The database should support consistent and secure transaction management.
-The interface should ensure data accuracy and smooth operations across all modules.
