User & Role

-Every user has a unique email ID and phone number.
-UserType determines high-level category (NormalUser or BankUser).
-Each user can hold only one role at a time (Customer, BankManager, or Admin), though the system supports multiple role mappings if extended.-
-Admins are responsible for creating banks, branches, and other users.

Age & Minor Handling

-The minimum age for independent account operation is 18 years.
-Users below 18 are treated as minors and must be linked to a GuardianId or POAUserId.
-The Guardian or POA must already exist as a valid, registered user in the system.
-Each minor can have only one Guardian or POA at a time.

Power of Attorney (POA)

-POA users can perform limited account operations on behalf of the account holder (e.g., deposits, withdrawals).
-POA cannot close or delete the account.
-A POA relationship is valid only during the lifetime of the account holder (no transfer of authority).-
-All POA operations are logged under the POA user’s ID for audit tracking.

Account Management

-Account numbers are unique across the entire system.
-An account is always linked to one User, one Branch, and one Currency.
-A user can have multiple accounts in different banks or branches.
-Term deposits are treated as a type of account (AccountType = TermDeposit).
-Each account maintains a balance, updated with every transaction.

Bank & Branch

-Each bank has a unique IFSC_Prefix.
-Each branch has a unique full IFSC code derived from its parent bank’s prefix.
-Each branch must be managed by one BankManager (linked to a user with UserType = BankUser).
-Authentication & Authorization
-All users must log in with credentials validated by the system.
-Roles and permissions are pre-defined and stored in Role and Permission tables.
-Every action (create, read, update, delete) must validate user permissions.

Default roles:

-Admin: Full system control
-BankManager: Can manage branches and customer accounts within their branch
-Customer: Can manage only their own accounts

Account Deletion Policy

-A normal user cannot delete or close another user’s account.
-Bank employees also cannot delete customer accounts.
-Only the account owner or admin can close the account, and only if the balance is zero.

Currency & Transactions

-Supported currencies include INR, USD, and GBP (can be extended later).
-Conversion between currencies is not handled by this system (assumed to be pre-converted).
-Every transaction has a timestamp and must belong to one account.
-Transaction types include: Deposit, Withdrawal, Transfer, Interest Credit.

Data Integrity & Relationships

-Deleting a user automatically deactivates their accounts but does not delete transaction history.
-Cascade deletes are disabled for safety; related entities must be updated manually.
-Each relationship follows the cardinality defined in statement.txt.

Scope Limitations

-The system does not handle real-time currency conversion, loan processing, or interest rate computation (can be future extensions).
-Joint accounts are not implemented in this version.
-No support for multiple guardians or multiple POAs per account (one-to-one link only).
-Assumes reliable network and database connectivity for all operations.
